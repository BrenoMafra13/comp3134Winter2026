1. What is the definition of a server port?

A server port is a logical endpoint used by an operating system to direct network traffic 
to a specific service or application. While an IP address identifies a machine, the port 
identifies the specific "door" through which data enters or leaves that machine.

2. What is the server port range?

The range extends from 0 to 65535. It is divided into Well-Known ports (0–1023), Registered ports (1024–49151), and Dynamic/Private ports (49152–65535).

3. How many bits does the number above represent?

The port number is represented by 16 bits. This is 
why the maximum value is $2^{16} - 1 = 65535$.
